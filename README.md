Quantum Art is a program that uses Quantum Computing to generate pixel art. By using pixel data from input images, superposition on quantum registers, and a pixel color decoding process, we are able to generate new pixel art. Quantum Art provides a fun interactive method to learn and experiment with the quantum world, and a graphical user interface is developed for easy interaction.
